**Allgemeine Hinweise zur weiteren Verwendung** 
    
* Beim Ver√∂ffentlichen eines wissenschaftlichen Beitrags √ºbertragen Autor\*innen in der Regel ausschlie√üliche Nutzungsrechte an die Verlage. Viele Zeitschriftenverlage gestattet eine Open-Access-Zweitver√∂ffentlichung und die Nachnutzung von Inhalten f√ºr weitere Ver√∂ffentlichungen durch die Autor\*innen selbst. Die Bedingungen der Verlage unterscheiden sich zum Teil stark, u.a. hinsichtlich der Nutzung von publizierten  und von unver√∂ffentlichten, eingereichten Beitr√§gen im Rahmen einer Dissertation.
* Hier aufgef√ºhrt werden Angaben aus **Standardvertr√§gen bzw. Standardpolicies** der Verlage, die frei recherchierbar sind. F√ºr den Fall, dass Sie mit dem Verlag abweichende Vereinbarungen getroffen haben, pr√ºfen Sie bitte die genauen Bestimmungen Ihres Verlagsvertrages.
* Falls der Artikel **Open Access** und unter einer freien Lizenz (Creative-Commons-Lizenz) beim Verlag erschienen ist, dann ist eine umfangreichere Nachnutzung als die hier genannte m√∂glich. Dies kann neben reinen Open-Access-Zeitschriften auch in Abo-pflichtigen Zeitschriften der Fall sein, falls der Artikel als sogenanntes hybrides Open Access frei gekauft wurde oder zu Open Access √ºber einen Publish-and-Read-Vertrag (z.B. [DEAL](https://www.projekt-deal.de/)) berechtigt war.
* Hier aufgef√ºhrt werden Informationen, die sich auf die Nutzung f√ºr **Online-Dissertationen** auf dem institutionellen Repositorium beziehen. Wenn Sie Ihre kumulative Dissertation in einem (kommerziellen) Verlag publizieren wollen, kl√§ren Sie dies direkt mit den Verlagen.
* Einige (nicht alle) Verlage machen ihre Bedingungen f√ºr die Open-Access-Zweitver√∂ffentlichung und die Nachnutzung von Inhalten f√ºr weitere Ver√∂ffentlichungen abh√§ngig von der Art der Publikation: **Zeitschriftenartikel** oder **Buchkapitel**. Diese √úbersicht deckt √ºberwiegend Policies f√ºr Zeitschriften ab; Policies f√ºr Buchkapitel wurden f√ºr einige Verlage erg√§nzt. Bitte √ºberpr√ºfen Sie sorgf√§ltig, ob die angef√ºhrte Policy auf Ihre Art von Beitrag anwendbar ist.
* **Allgemein gilt**: Sie m√ºssen die **Quelle der Erstver√∂ffentlichung** korrekt und vollst√§ndig angeben und mithilfe der **DOI auf die Verlagsversion verlinken**. Dar√ºberhinaus beachten Sie bitte ggf. die besonderen Auflagen der Verlage (**"Special requirements"**).
* Prinzipiell ist die Vergabe einer Open-Access-konformen **freien Lizenz** (v.a. Creative Commons Namensnennung, CC BY) zu begr√º√üen. F√ºr kumulative Dissertationen wird die Vergabe einer freien Lizenz im Allgemeinen nicht empfohlen, wenn bereits exklusive Rechte an Verlage abgetreten wurden.
* Unten aufgef√ºhrt sind allgemeine Hinweise. Um eine andere Version nutzen zu k√∂nnen, eine Verk√ºrzung der Embargofrist zu verhandeln o.√Ñ. m√ºssen Sie die Genehmigung direkt beim Verlag einholen. Die meisten Verlage arbeiten f√ºr die Lizenzvergabe mit dem [RightsLink Service](http://www.copyright.com/rightsholders/rightslink-permissions/) des Copyright Clearance Center zusammen.

<summary>üá∫üá∏ In English</summary>
    
* When publishing a paper, authors usually transfer exclusive rights to the publisher. Most publishers have policies on self-archving and authors' own re-use of the content. Publisher terms differ though, e.g. regarding re-use of published papers and inclusion of yet unpublished, submitted papers in a thesis.
* Listed here are details extracted from **standardized policies and copyright agreements** that are freely available online. In case you have agreed to deviating terms with the publisher, please check your copyright agreement and follow the respective terms.
* If the article was published open access and distributed under an open content license (Creative Commons license) there are a wider re-use options than described below. In addition to genuine open access journals, this can also be the case in subscription-based journals if the article was paid for on a single fee basis (so called hybrid open access) or Open Access was covered as part of a publish-and-read contract (e.g. [DEAL](https://www.projekt-deal.de/)).
* Listed here is information that relates to use for **online theses** (published via the institutional repository). If you want to publish your cumulative thesis with a (commercial) publisher, please check permissions/terms directly with the publishers.
* Some (not all) publishers have different policies for self-archiving and re-use depending on the type of publication: **journal article** or **book chapter**. While this list focuses on journal articles, some policies for book chapters are also included. Please check carefully whether the described policy applies to your type of contribution.
* **In general**: You must provide a **proper, full citation** and use the **DOI to link to the publisher's version**. In addition, please check whether the publisher has any **Special requirements**, if applicable.
* While the use of an open access compliant **free license** (especially Creative Commons Attribution, CC BY) is advisable in general, it is not recommended for a thesis by publication (cumulative dissertation) if exclusive rights have already been assigned to publishers.
* Listed below are general terms. Obtain permission to use a different version, shorten the embargo period, or the like. Most publishers handle permissions with help of the [RightsLink service](http://www.copyright.com/rightsholders/rightslink-permissions/) by the Copyright Clearance Center.
