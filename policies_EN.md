## General terms for re-use
* Listed here are details extracted from standardized policies and copyright agreements that are freely available online. In case you have agreed to deviating terms with the publisher please check your copyright agreement and follow the respective terms.
* Listed here are policies for re-use of journal articles; very often policies for re-use of book chapters deviate.
* You always have to give a proper, full citation and use the DOI to link to the published version! 
* Please check publishers &quot;[Special requirements](#policies)&quot; in column 4!
* Listed below are *general* terms. Obtain permission to use a different version, shorten the embargo period, or the like. Most publishers handle permissions with help of the [RightsLink service](http://www.copyright.com/rightsholders/rightslink-permissions/) by the Copyright Clearance Center.
* Some (not all) publishers have different policies for self-archiving and re-use depending on the publication type: journal article or book chapter. While this list focuses on policies that cover journal articles  some policies for book chapters are also included. Please check carefully whether the described policy applies to your type of contribution.

## Hybrid journals
* Many publishers have hybrid business models for all or some journals, so called hybrid journals. These journals generally charge subscription fees for access, while single articles are published open access after paying an open access fee (Article Processing Charge, APC).
* If these single open access articles are published under an open content license (e.g. Creative Commons) there are a wider re-use options than described in the [table below](#policies).

## Glossary
* Preprint: originally submitted version; synonyms: submitted version, author’s original version
* Postprint: version of an article that reflects all changes made during the review process, but that is not layouted by the publisher or enhanced otherwise; synonyms: accepted manuscript, accepted version, peer-reviewed version, final draft
* Published version: final, published version; synonyms: publisher PDF, version of record, final version
* Embargo: some publishers permit delayed self-archiving or other re-use, i.e. upon expiry of an embargo period
